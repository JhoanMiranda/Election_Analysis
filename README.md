# Election Analysis

This analysis was made, with the purpose to help Seth and Tom finding the winner of the election with detailed information.
Data after been analyzed was filtered by candidates and counties.
Doing that we could get the total amount of voters on each countie and at the end highlight Denver as the county where the people voted the most.
 
Thinking about the end user we delivered the information differently, data was shorted by candidates with the total  and transformed into percentages.
The analysis was performed in a way that data can be updated, and the analysis will give the lates information.
Results are delivered in a .txt file with the following information at this moment.

#### Greetings


I would like to inform you that this is a reusable code, with some small changes can be use with different data , more candidates, counties  and  voters can be add it and still show the results.
Replacing some values can be used for a presidential election shorting the data by states or any election.
